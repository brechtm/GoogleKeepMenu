# GoogleKeepMenu

Access Google Keep from the macOS menu bar

This is basically a copy of Travers McInerney's [Keep](http://trav.sh/keep/),
but implemented as a native macOS application using Swift instead of Electron
in order to use less resources.

## Installation

Binaries are available from [releases](https://github.com/brechtm/GoogleKeepMenu/releases).
